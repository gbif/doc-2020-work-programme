=== Activity 2b: Deliver names infrastructure

==== Tasks
[lowerroman]
. Partner with other biodiversity informatics initiatives and taxonomic database holders to plan and deliver a comprehensive nomenclatural dataset and working consensus classification for all life
. Promote publication of species checklists through GBIF network
. Explore potential use of checklists to assist with data validation or derive augmented data products
. Explore integration of Linnaean nomenclature of formally described taxa with provisional names and species hypotheses and OTU naming

==== 2019 Progress

A new IT infrastructure for building and maintaining GBIF backbone taxonomy is near completion. This new infrastructure came from a collaboration with the Catalogue of Life (COL) and includes a clearinghouse for nomenclature and taxonomy. This infrastructure was designed to replace the GBIF Checklistbank. This infrastructure will be used by GBIF and COL and is available service for other initiatives. GBIF is working with COL to provide tools, including a web-based console for editors and technicians. The checklist is being monitored and will replace the GBIF backbone when suitably complete in coverage. The design and deployment of the new public Catalogue of Life website is scheduled for later in 2019.

The adoption of Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) identifiers from the UNITE fungal database and the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) in the Catalogue of Life is scheduled for the second half of 2019.

==== 2020 Work items

*	Maintain and update processes for constructing the GBIF taxonomic backbone, including monitoring the content and helping to prioritize editorial effort. â‚¬108,000 has been allocated in the budget to support GBIF costs. This work is in collaboration with the Catalogue of Life.
*	Implement a process enabling key checklists to be used in filtering occurrence data, such as Red Listed species and invasive alien species.
*	Consult with relevant regulatory agencies, such as the European Environment Agency (EEA), for guidance on which legislative checklists should be incorporated to increase the relevance of COL+ to governments. 
*	Explore feasibility of supporting national taxonomies for exploring GBIF occurrence data to better enable national level reporting.
*	Develop and pilot a process that allows qualified users to collaborate and edit sectors that contribute to the GBIF backbone taxonomy, aimed at reducing the delays before such edits appear on occurrence records from months to days.

==== Rationale

The most significant challenge to improving the quality of aggregated occurrence data is the continuing need for a comprehensive checklist of known species, and even for a comprehensive list of published scientific names. Interpreting and mapping names depends on the quality and completeness of these resources. Even in cases where names in occurrence records are incorrect or misspelled, better names infrastructure can assist by increasing confidence that fuzzy match algorithms or human intervention is required.

Delivering these resources is the focus of a number of GBIF Participants and other stakeholders, including the Catalogue of Life partnership, WoRMS, nomenclators (IPNI, Index Fungorum, ZooBank) and many national, regional or taxonomic databases. A comprehensive resource for scientific names and taxon concepts organized at least as a workable reference classification (but with support for additional classifications as appropriate) would also benefit other infrastructures, including Encyclopedia of Life, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Barcode of Life and GBIF nodes, and improve interoperability between data from these infrastructures. It would also be beneficial to accommodate vernacular names, informal names for undescribed species and other identifiers such as Barcode Index Numbers.

==== Approach

GBIF and many other partners have worked on this challenge and much progress has been made, but we are still far from a comprehensive shared solution. GBIF has been in discussion with Catalogue of Life, EOL, BHL, BOLD Systems, nomenclators and others about pooling resources to deliver the best possible complete nomenclator and catalogue of all species, along with improved tools to enable the taxonomic community to own and maintain these resources more effectively. The challenges are not primarily informatics issues. The most important requirement is to understand the constraints and needs of existing content holders and the features that are required from an infrastructure that can be embraced by the majority of taxonomists. The solution must build on existing initiatives and give sufficient credit and benefit back to those who have invested in developing data. It must be flexible enough to accommodate existing well-managed datasets without disrupting their activity and to accommodate more open mechanisms to support wide community input for taxa which need more work. In the longer term, it should support evolution towards ownership of curation responsibilities by international taxonomic societies or other bodies recognized by researchers for each group. The infrastructure should include processes to review and interpret unrecognized name strings found by GBIF and others in aggregated data. Once these requirements have been resolved, implementation must rapidly follow to offer these resources as open public datasets for use by all.

The Netherlands has coordinated a significant commitment for 2017 and 2018, led by NLBIF and including resources both from Species 2000 and Naturalis. This funding will enable GBIF and partners to direct significant effort to this area over the period.
