<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents, except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the house-tops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness. Through one of the obscurest quarters of London, and among haunts little loved by the gentlemen of the police, a man, evidently of the lowest orders, was wending his solitary way. He stopped twice or thrice at different shops and houses of a description correspondent with the appearance of the quartier in which they were situated, and tended inquiry for some article or another which did not seem easily to be met with. All the answers he received were couched in the negative; and as he turned from each door he muttered to himself, in no very elegant phraseology, his disappointment and discontent. At length, at one house, the landlord, a sturdy butcher, after rendering the same reply the inquirer had hitherto received, added, “But if this vill do as vell, Dummie, it is quite at your sarvice!” Pausing reflectively for a moment, Dummie responded that he thought the thing proffered might do as well; and thrusting it into his ample pocket, he strode away with as rapid a motion as the wind and the rain would allow. He soon came to a nest of low and dingy buildings, at the entrance to which, in half-effaced characters, was written “Thames Court.” Halting at the most conspicuous of these buildings, an inn or alehouse, through the half-closed windows of which blazed out in ruddy comfort the beams of the hospitable hearth, he knocked hastily at the door.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Strategic Plan 2017-2021 presents five broad overlapping priorities for the GBIF network. Each of these priorities sets a direction and guides activities for the coming period. This document here presents an Implementation Plan to enable the GBIF community as a whole to make significant progress in each priority area. It establishes the framework for GBIF’s Annual Work Programmes over the period of the Strategic Plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following notes provide context for the activities outlined here.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_delivery"><a class="anchor" href="#_delivery"></a>Delivery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some activities in this plan will be led or coordinated by GBIF Secretariat staff, using core or supplementary funds. Other activities may be led or coordinated by GBIF Participants with particular interest or expertise in the areas in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Combining energies across the whole network within the framework of this plan will enable GBIF to progress the set of activities identified in this document more rapidly. Each Annual Work Programme in the period 2017 to 2021 will build on progress in past years and will focus available resources on remaining priorities identified in this document.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_structure_of_gbif"><a class="anchor" href="#_structure_of_gbif"></a>Structure of GBIF</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF operates on three primary levels:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Global</strong> – GBIF is an international activity and works at the global level to increase standardization and adoption of best practices, to facilitate sharing of expertise and resources and to offer an integrated global dataset and associated informatics infrastructure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participant</strong> – GBIF Participants, including the nodes that they establish, have primary responsibility for engaging stakeholder communities, mobilizing and curating data, providing support and training, and ensuring that national researchers and agencies gain maximum benefit from GBIF. GBIF regional networks provide a framework for national and organizational stakeholders to collaborate more closely, particularly when addressing challenges and opportunities they share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Publisher</strong> – Data-holding institutions, agencies and individual researchers are the foundations on which GBIF depends. GBIF has a responsibility to ensure that data publishers have access to the tools and support that they need and that they receive recognition for their work and contributions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Implementation Plan seeks to address needs at all three of these levels while aiming to reinforce the value of GBIF for stakeholders at each level. It is highly desirable to increase coordination and feedback between these levels. The 2019 version of the document includes reports from a few GBIF Participants on their 2018 activities and 2019 plans. It would be most beneficial to receive inputs from a wider range of Participants to give a clear picture of everything occurring in the network and to assist the Secretariat and all Participants with better alignment and reuse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A particular requirement is for the GBIF network to maintain and coordinate software to support each of these levels and to ensure that the publication, integration, management and use of data are as efficient as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the global level, GBIF focuses on delivery of GBIF.org as a software platform to support both human users and tools (via web services). Many of GBIF’s goals depend on being able to deliver a fully integrated view of all data from all sources in the best possible forms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the data publisher level, GBIF maintains the Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) as its default tool for sharing GBIF-compatible data. Ongoing enhancements are required to increase both the usability of this tool and the value that its services provide to data publishers. At the same time, GBIF seeks to support GBIF-compatible data publishing via other tools such as collection management systems and citizen science platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the Participant level, several efforts have been made to deliver generic portal tools to assist node managers in their work and to deliver value at the national level. The most significant roles for such a platform would be to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enable national- or regional-level integration and curation of datasets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance data records to reflect national administrative units and national species lists</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide tools that meet the requirements of national or regional researchers, policymakers and the general public</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the last few years, a growing number of GBIF Participants have collaborated to leverage Australia’s investment in the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) and to customize these tools to deliver their own portals. The Implementation Plan responds to this with a focus on increasing community development and support to deliver a reusable and sustainable portal toolkit based on the ALA tools. This approach not only benefits Participants already committed to using these tools, but also provides a solution for rapid adoption by other Participants at national, regional, or even thematic levels. In addition, Belgium has indicated an interest in exploring the potential for an alternative lightweight solution based on repository tools such as CKAN.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The vision for the technical aspects underlying this Implementation Plan is that the components developed and offered by the GBIF network at each scale should combine to deliver a robust solution to support GBIF data management and that together they should continue to evolve to support a leading international data infrastructure. One aspect of this will be to ensure that all users can share and reuse common components such as data validation tests and that GBIF promotes and fosters wider activity around open projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF is more than just a technical network, and this Implementation Plan also addresses the capacity enhancement, networking, communication and reporting activities necessary to advance GBIF’s work in these areas. Since it is impossible for GBIF to support all aspects of its network using core funds, this plan focuses on resources which will support the work of GBIF Participants and data holders everywhere, coordinating the skills, expertise and investment of the whole network to maximize benefits to all stakeholders.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_timeline"><a class="anchor" href="#_timeline"></a>Timeline</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of the priorities, or the more specific goals identified for each priority, can be achieved in a single year; each will require coordinated effort across multiple annual work programmes. This document describes the set of activities currently recognized as important to deliver the Strategic Plan over the five-year period. It will be revised and expanded as required each year to address changes in the landscape in which GBIF operates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Implementation Plan was presented for approval by the Governing Board at GB23. It was accompanied by the Annual Work Programme for 2017. Both components were approved at the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additional commitments from GBIF Participants or others to contribute or deliver particular elements will be welcomed throughout the five-year implementation period.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Implementation Plan is structured around the five priorities identified in the GBIF Strategic Plan 2017-2021. These are presented here in reverse order from their sequence in the Strategic Plan, and numbered accordingly. This reordering allows the Implementation Plan to place its initial focus squarely on the global network of GBIF Participants and data publishers, building on these foundations to address in turn GBIF’s informatics, content mobilization, curation and delivered products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For each of the five priorities, the plan presents a series of numbered Activities. These are the major areas where GBIF needs to develop further in the coming period. A rationale and implementation approach is presented for each Activity.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF is the result of work by thousands of people in agencies and institutions worldwide. This network’s long-term sustainability depends on demonstrating the value of such contributions and justifying continued investment of effort.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat can enhance efforts to develop capacity within the network and build an effective distributed help desk system that acknowledges and showcases relevant skills and experience that people across the network possess. Users of GBIF data products would also benefit from showcasing the network’s indispensible human resources and their impact on assessing and improving biodiversity data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these reasons, the next round of improvements to GBIF.org should enhance the network’s capacity to serve as a hub for the GBIF community by identifying its active contributors, integrating information on their relevant GBIF activities, and supporting broader knowledge exchange and skill development.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The key task is to enhance GBIF.org to connect and display information on its contributors and other users of the site. This may include contact details (subject to individual control), formal roles (e.g. within participant delegations; in connection to publishing/improving datasets; based on training experience) and online participation in help desk discussions. Whether through the use of existing social or commercial platforms or through custom web application development, GBIF.org should absorb activity currently handled through the separate GBIF community site. GBIF should also build on experience during 2015-2016 in using digital badges to identify skills held by individuals. Such community functions will support the operation of GBIF Task Groups, externally funded projects like BID, and engagement of expert groups to curate GBIF data.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2018_progress"><a class="anchor" href="#_2018_progress"></a>2018 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users of GBIF.org can already associate their account with their ORCID, and log in using ORCID as the identity provider. Further implementation of this activity during 2018 has been somewhat delayed as GBIF explores the implications of the European Union’s new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) on measures that directly target publicly-available information about individuals. Having taken the necessary legal advice, GBIF can proceed with confidence to implement an expanded user profile, enabling users to link relevant information about their own activities and affiliations, for public display on GBIF.org if this option is selected. This will include, for example, information on the user’s data publishing record, citation of GBIF-mediated data in research, skills certification and volunteer roles through digital badges (see below in this section). Further information may include individual species occurrence records for which the user is named as recorder or identifier, and even verified species descriptions published in the taxonomic literature. The first test version of this new feature may be implemented within 2018, or scheduled for 2019. A mockup of the potential content of these profiles may be seen here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new GBIF Community Forum was launched in May 2018, using the open-source Discourse platform to provide an open discussion space for the GBIF community. Moderated by the Secretariat communications team, the forum combines open discussion among registered users with closed groups for internal communication between nodes. Following a 15-month trial period, usage of the platform will be evaluated and recommendations on its future presented to the Global Nodes Meeting and Governing Board in Q4 2019. The Community Forum is intended to replicate and enhance those functions of the former GBIF Community Site not available through GBIF.org and other platforms such as GitHub, Open Science Framework, Google Drive and mailing lists. The Community Site itself was retired during 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF continued development of the digital badge scheme to recognize skills and roles among individuals in the GBIF community. During 2018, three badges recognizing mentors and certified trainers within the Biodiversity Information Development (BID) programme, were extended to wider application across GBIF programmes and projects, as GBIF Volunteer Mentor (signifying general availability to act as a mentor and familiarity with the mentoring programme), GBIF Project Mentor (signifying specific experience in mentoring a project or providing on-site mentoring at training workshops) and GBIF Certified Trainer (signifying experience of taking part as a trainer in a GBIF capacity enhancement workshop). Three new badges are in preparation covering the new roles of Node Mentor (see Activity 1c), Biodiversity Open Data Ambassador (see Activities 1c and 5a) and Volunteer Translator (see Activity 1e).</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_2"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strengthening of personal skills through international collaboration has been one of the great successes of the GBIF global network. During this implementation period, GBIF must build on this past experience (including the support mechanisms developed for the BID programme) to reinforce efficient training and capacity enhancement across the network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Central to this is the development of a collaborative help desk capability and the alignment of relevant aspects of national training initiatives with a global curriculum to facilitate direct reuse of resources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_2"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To strengthen key skills, GBIF needs to develop and maintain a comprehensive set of clear reference information and training materials that support all GBIF audiences. Since 2016, the Secretariat has been upgrading documentation to deliver this comprehensive resource, first via concise explanatory text materials (including numerous translations by network members into French, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Russian). Some of these text materials will be supported by short videos that present key functional and operational aspects of GBIF. The aim is to deliver a structured set of short, clear, current and complete documents that enable GBIF stakeholders to gain an understanding of relevant aspects of GBIF’s work quickly, including formal Participation, establishing a national or thematic node, planning digitization, mobilizing data, discovering and using data, citing data, among others. This work complements significant activity among Participants to produce information and training materials relevant to particular audiences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF will organize all these materials to form a curriculum that builds and supports the skills and activities identified in GBIF’s self-assessment tools for nodes and data holders. A core set of these resources should provide new stakeholders with an effective introduction to GBIF’s structure, roles, approaches and solutions. Other more technical resources will provide the additional detail needed by those working in specific areas like digitization, data publishing and use of GBIF-mediated data. The Secretariat will coordinate ongoing maintenance and updates to this curriculum with contributions and translations from the network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2018_progress_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_2018_progress_2"></a>2018 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat in collaboration with trainers from the GBIF community has made significant progress in refining and streamlining course materials developed through the BID programme to support data mobilization skills among project teams, for adaptation and re-use in a wide range of programmes in any region. In addition, a new set of training modules for use of open-access biodiversity data in decision making has been developed for three separate regional training workshops within BID, also with the intention of making standard materials available for rolling out in any region and for re-use by nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consolidation of course materials for data mobilization, tested and adapted in four separate BID capacity enhancement workshops in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific in 2016-17, enabled replication of the training modules in four additional workshop settings during 2018: 1) in Montenegro in April, within a project on biodiversity information management and reporting in the Western Balkans, funded by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenheit (GIZ); 2) in Moscow in April to support mobilization of data from Russian institutions in a project funded by GBIF Finland; 3) in Beijing in June, to support data mobilization projects funded in the latest call under the Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia (BIFA) using supplementary funds provided by the Ministry of Environment, Japan; and 4) at Lake Baikal, Siberia in September, in a training event on mobilization of data using both GBIF tools and barcoding techniques through the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD), supported through Norway’s ForBio programme.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In collaboration with several partners including UNEP-WCMC, IUCN and SANBI, the Secretariat developed an additional training curriculum to support data use for decision making during 2018 as part of the BID programme. The curriculum is designed to equip participants with the theoretical skills they require to produce selected biodiversity information products and to integrate them into the decision-making process. Specific topics included in the curriculum include data cleaning, species distribution modelling and mapping, assessing species conservation status and mainstreaming biodiversity data by identifying key policy entry points. This curriculum was rolled out at a workshop in Cape Town, South Africa in April for all BID-funded project teams in Africa and repeated for Pacific projects in New Zealand in September, with a further edition planned for November in Suriname for BID Caribbean projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mentoring and collaborative helpdesk approach developed through the BID programme has been significantly widened during 2018, to be applied across the GBIF community. A webinar in July helped to recruit new mentors, and a new web page explains the mentoring approach. By September 2018, 76 volunteer mentors had offered to contribute their time and skills to support capacity development in the network. Volunteer mentors contributed on-site support at all of the training workshops mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of explainer texts for key GBIF activities expanded in 2018 with an explainer on data hosting and two more are in the pipeline on Creative Commons licensing and API access. A set of explainer texts on the use of GBIF-mediated data is in preparation with a dedicated section planned for this topic in the top-level navigation of GBIF.org.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By coordinating national, regional and thematic networks, Participant nodes play an essential role in helping GBIF engage the broadest possible community of institutions, initiatives and individuals engaged in biodiversity informatics. GBIF must provide learning materials and tools to support nodes efficiently as they work to mobilize biodiversity data, promote the reuse of available data and support users by improving data management and quality. Preferred approaches enable any one node to invest in developing tools and capacity that others can easily leverage for the benefit of the whole community. The skills and experience of the node managers and other team members are recognized as uniquely valuable in helping new Participants establish their nodes and allowing the community to develop together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_3"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_3"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF promotes capacity self-assessment as a tool to help nodes with planning and tracking progress at all stages in the development of national biodiversity information facilities. The results of these assessments can also identify important capacity needs to address with learning materials, tools and collaborative projects. The reuse and adaptation of the Atlas of Living Australia’s open-source software tools by a growing community of nodes between 2013 and 2016 is an example of successful collaboration based on the mutual needs of the countries involved. Additional support for this international partnership will allow still more nodes to benefit from the collective resources and expertise to build websites that provide biodiversity data and services to a range of national and regional user communities. The nodes’ teams will also engage in collaborative helpdesk activities to enable them to share knowledge across the scientific and technical domains handled by the nodes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2018_progress_3"><a class="anchor" href="#_2018_progress_3"></a>2018 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat is reviewing the well-used guidance document Establishing and Effective GBIF Participant Node, and will provide an updated version before the end of 2018, including better links with the capacity self-assessment tool, guidance for organizational nodes and on the division of roles between node managers and GBIF Heads of Delegation. In addition, the review has identified the need for more examples and case studies from across the nodes community to complement the generic guidance materials. Work has begun to document guiding examples on thematic aspects of node activity, with early contributions contributed by Belgium, Australia and Norway on collaboration with IPBES, engaging academia and mobilization of data from the private sector, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The national capacity self-assessment tool is in wide use across the nodes community, and has been especially helpful in tracking progress in capacity enhancement over the course of projects funded through the BID programme. A new, more user-friendly format of the tool is under development, making it easier to track progress over time, with new versions contributed by the community in French, Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the final quarter of 2018, GBIF is trialling a new Node Mentoring programme in which dedicated individual volunteer mentors (see Activity 1b) are assigned to newly-established nodes, with South Sudan, Zimbabwe and Vietnam providing the first examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bimonthly GBIF network webinars have continued to generate a good response from nodes, as a way of keeping the community updated on implementation of the Work Programme as well as sharing examples and best practices from around the network. Migration from the Adobe Connect to the Zoom platform has enabled much more efficient packaging of videos from the webinars, and appears easy to use for participants.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new Biodiversity Open Data Ambassador programme was developed and rolled out during 2018. Initially scoped at a joint meeting of the Nodes Steering Group and Science Committee in Copenhagen in February, the programme is designed to enlist willing biodiversity professionals to help advocate open data practices in relevant research and policy communities, using a package of tools and resources provided by GBIF. Close connections will be encouraged with nodes to help strengthen connections with national user groups. The first set of ambassadors was recruited at the GBIC2 meeting in July, and the programme will be further developed in the last quarter of 2018, including development of the information toolkit available to ambassadors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Living Atlas activity merits greater investment. The ALA has provided significant support from within its team, and GBIF has supported workshops through the CESP funds. For greater stability, it would be preferable for the community of stakeholders outside Australia to secure funding to support a full-time coordinator to mediate requirements with the work of the ALA team and to assist in planning to support more ALA components through collaborative development and support strategies.</p>

<h4 id="_rationale_4"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_4"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Data publishers are an essential component of the GBIF network as they share their content through the common infrastructure. More than 800 data publishers actively distribute datasets through GBIF.org, and their ranks increase steadily. Publishers from different parts of the world often face unique challenges, though common themes emerge. These problems range from lack of data publishing experience or skills, lack of equipment, language barriers, difficulties in managing data hosting facilities, and the inability to publish high-quality data or curate data into the future. The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) requires ongoing improvements and enhancements, including the establishment of hosted instances that reduce the technical burden on data publishers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_4"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_4"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following the model of the self-assessment tool for node managers, the Secretariat has developed a self-assessment tool for data publishers as part of the support for the BID programme, which will guide the work with collection managers and other data holders to assess and prioritize areas for capacity enhancement or investment. The Secretariat already operates instances of the IPT that data publishers lacking their own infrastructure may use, and Participants are encouraged to deploy instances of the IPT or other GBIF-compatible data publishing software to support data holding institutions. Planned enhancements to the IPT will simplify publishing pathways using spreadsheet templates as an alternative for the less advanced data publishers. GBIF will improve reporting to data publishers on both quality aspects of their data and uses of data documented through download DOI citations.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_2018_progress_4"><a class="anchor" href="#_2018_progress_4"></a>2018 Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT) is being maintained to deal with bug fixes, translations etc., and version 2.3.6 was released during 2018. Review of requirements for a revised IPT is on hold until there is greater clarity on how broad a data model for GBIF should be (see Activity 2a). With a new model in place, GBIF will design appropriate tools to map and publish data.
The cloud-based IPT infrastructure maintained by the Secretariat continues to provide a fallback solution for publishers unable to host their own installation or to find a third-party hosting option. As of September 2018, this option was being used by six publishers associated with the BID programme, sharing a total of 52 datasets. Cloud-hosted IPTs are expected to become more widely used in coming months, especially with the plan to use volunteer mentors to provide helpdesk support for users of this option (see 2019 work items in this section).
The Secretariat in collaboration with the Nodes Steering Group continued in 2018 to identify and attempt to resolve remaining log-jams in the process of endorsing new publisher wishing to share data through the GBIF network. To address isolated cases in which publishers experience extended delays in response to an endorsement request from a participant node, the NSG agreed to amend the
endorsement guidelines to enable community-level endorsement as a last resort if the node remains unresponsive. Further review of these guidelines is planned for the final quarter of 2018.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF’s national membership has remained largely static in recent years. Active participation in the network is confined to a limited number of regions, with the most dynamic activity in node collaboration and data publication focused in Western Europe, North America, Latin America, Oceania, increasingly sub-Saharan Africa and limited parts of Asia. Thus, significant parts of the world have little or no direct involvement in GBIF’s activities, which poses a risk to the long-term credibility of GBIF as a global collaborative network. Secretariat staff and existing Participants constantly engage potential new members through ad hoc contacts, but the situation calls for a more strategic approach to expand membership.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_5"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_5"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Secretariat will compile and maintain an up-to-date register of the status of GBIF engagement and relevant contacts in all countries, providing the Governing Board with an annual review that analyses progress and remaining gaps in membership across each region. Following the development of a coordinated engagement plan for each region, Participants and regional groups with strong contacts to relevant agencies in other governments may take the lead in engagement. The Secretariat will continue to develop strategic engagement through the CBD and other intergovernmental networks, as well as through the BID programme and other capacity-related activities. Adapting the GBIF.org interface to support key content in multiple languages will seek to address language barriers to national expansion, with targeted translation carried out both through external contracts and in-kind services provided by Participants.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following comprehensive back-end preparation by the Secretariat informatics team during the first part of 2018, the communications team began a pilot phase with the network’s Spanish and Japanese language communities to test workflows, tools and processes for translating GBIF.org.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Translation of the user interface (navigation menus, table headings, field labels etc.) relied on CrowdIn, a tool previously used in translating the IPT interface. By mid-August, the work of a team of three Japanese and ten Spanish volunteers had substantially completed translation of the UI, leading to the release of a language switcher that allows users to view GBIF.org in English (<a href="https://www.gbif.org" class="bare">https://www.gbif.org</a>), Japanese (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/ja" class="bare">https://www.gbif.org/ja</a>) Spanish (<a href="https://www.gbif.org/es" class="bare">https://www.gbif.org/es</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the pilot phase well-advanced, volunteers from other language communities are translating the UI and key content following a call for volunteers at the end of August, with some including Portuguese making very rapid progress. Where volunteer effort proves insufficient, commercial translators will be contracted. The intention is to have the UI available in five UN languages (English, French, Russian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese), plus Portuguese and Japanese, by the end of 2018. Because of the additional technical adjustments needed to support right-to-left script, Arabic translation is deferred until 2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modest growth in the number of national participants in GBIF continued in 2018, with South Sudan, Zimbabwe, Cameroon and Viet Nam joining as Associate Participant Countries. Liberia also formally communicated its intent to join as a Voting Participant, and several other African countries are working towards participation as part of activities under the BID programme. Discussions continue with a number of other potential participants in Asia, the Caribbean, Central America, North Africa and the Former Soviet Union regions. The Secretariat continues to seek appropriate routes to build on successful institutional engagement and data publishing activity both in Russia and China to secure national government participation in each of these countries.</p>

<p>The 2nd Global Biodiversity Informatics Conference (GBIC2) was held in Copenhagen during July 2018, with more than 100 attendees from all global regions. The workshop received external sponsorship from Agence française pour la biodiversité, the Atlas of Living Australia, DiSSCo, the Field Museum, iDigBio, the JRS Foundation, MCZ Harvard, NLBIF, Pensoft and UN Environment, and GBIF was granted free access to Copenhagen University meeting areas. GBIC2 followed from the first GBIC in 2012, which delivered the Global Biodiversity Informatics Outlook (GBIO). The GBIO provided a vision and framework for “delivering biodiversity knowledge in the Information Age” through modular delivery of biodiversity information infrastructure. Progress since 2012 has been uneven, primarily because of the complexity and diversity within the landscape of stakeholders in biodiversity knowledge, with overlapping missions and weakly aligned funding. GBIC2 attendees proposed the establishment of a lightweight international alliance to support open planning and collaborative delivery of the tools, services and infrastructure necessary to organise all biodiversity data. The GBIF Secretariat was tasked with leading on development of a paper outlining this proposal, and on seeking to establish such an alliance. Relevant models for the alliance can be seen in the Apache Software Foundation (collaborative open source development), ELIXIR (coordination of bioinformatics data services), and the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (a closely parallel effort to facilitate community delivery of scalable global solutions).</p>

A limited amount of funding has been allocated each year under the GBIF work programme to support capacity enhancement for GBIF nodes.

The GBIF Secretariat seeks information from all Participants on planned activities and commitments which may help to advance the work of other Participants or GBIF globally – examples may include funding for workshops; committed resources to develop tools, standards or best practices; mentoring actions; etc. These will be recorded as part of the overall GBIF Work Programme and updates will be presented in the GBIF annual report. A shared Implementation Plan also offers the opportunity for GBIF (either the Secretariat or Participants) to develop concept notes to seek supplementary funding to target currently unfunded or underfunded areas. The annual Capacity Enhancement Support Programme budget includes only limited funds, but existing supplementary funds (in particular BID and BIFA) align with these funds and leverage CESP tools and processes. Future supplementary funds should follow a similar model.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BID programme reached its most intensive year of implementation in 2018 with management of 63 projects in sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific and capacity enhancement workshops in all three regions focused on data use for decision making (see Activity 1b). A full 2018 progress report on BID, including its contribution to wider GBIF activities in all regions, and a process for consulting on a possible second phase of BID once the current programme completes its implementation in 2019, is provided as a separate document to the Governing Board at its GB25 meeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia (BIFA) attracted a strong response in its latest call for proposals for data mobilization projects. After a rigorous selection process, eight projects were selected for funding in Cambodia, Indonesia, Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and Vietnam. This year’s call replicated the model developed under BID in providing a common training workshop for all funded projects to acquire basic data publishing skills to support project implementation. The workshop was hosted in Beijing by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and was supported by trainers and mentors from several GBIF nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A fifth call for the Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP) was launched in 2018, resulting in selection of six projects for funding, managed by nodes in Europe, North America, Africa and Latin America. As requested by the Governing Board at its GB24 meeting in 2017, the Secretariat carried out a five-year review of the CESP programme involving a survey of nodes and analysis of outcomes of the funded projects, as well as the procedures for running the programme. The results of the review including a set of recommendations is presented to GB25, with an overriding recommendation that the programme should be continued with some adjustments reflecting the feedback received during the review.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Annual calls in 2018 under the The Young Researchers Award and Ebbe Nielsen Challenge programmes attracted significantly better response than in 2017. The results will be announced during the GB25 meeting.</p>

<p><em>previously *2019 work items*</em>
* Subject to approval by GB25 of recommendations made in the five-year review of the Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP), launch a 2019 call for proposals under a renewed CESP, taking account of the feedback received during the review. This call specifically to exclude support for core activities under the Living Atlas programme, to be funded and coordinated separately (see Activity 1c).
* Complete implementation of the current BID programme, including a) closing all remaining projects and delivering necessary documentation to the EU; b) commissioning impact report to analyse the return on investment including mobilized data, capacity enhancement and additional policy support in the target regions; c) publishing guiding examples and best practices developed through BID on mobilization and use of data for priority policy needs; d) organizing closing meetings in each target region to showcase outcomes and develop sustainability plans including through increased GBIF participation (see Activity 1e); and e) organizing a BID closing event, probably in association with GB26, to promote the outcomes to the wider community and propose next steps.
* Based on the outcomes of the community consultation on the BID programme, develop proposals for a second phase of BID in collaboration with the European Union and the BID Steering Committee
* Implement a fourth call for proposals under the Biodiversity Information Fund for Asia (BIFA), reflecting priorities agreed by Asian nodes and the BIFA Steering Committee, and conclude discussions with the Government of Japan to decide the future of this supplementary fund beyond 2019
* Work with all GBIF regions to identify and target potential funding streams to support additional capacity enhancement for data mobilization and use, building on the BID and BIFA models
* Roll out selected grant management system to streamline project calls, assessment, selection, implementation, budgeting and reporting, with continuous refinement and evaluation of the system to ensure it is meeting the needs of the community.
* Launch 2019 calls for the Ebbe Nielsen Challenge and Young Researchers Awards, taking into account recommendations from the Science Committee based on the 2018 programmes.</p>

* South Africa: Further engagement with regards to funding allocation will continue. The Africa Coordination Mechanism (ACM) 5 year strategy is seen as a catalytic investment. Sustainability will be built into the 1st phase, so there will be less concern about what happens subsequently, as this would have been built into the model. The ACM Business Case and Regional Engagement Strategy is a model that could be adopted in other regions of the world.
* South Africa: In the 1st three years, through the ACM, GBIF-Africa, through SANBI-GBIF will explore the need and feasibility of developing a bigger platform that can provide for a strengthening of a community of practice for all African biodiversity informatics initiatives, to enhance and make more efficient use of the data. This will be done through leveraging additional regional and global partnerships and initiatives.

<h4 id="_rationale_8"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale_8"></a>Rationale</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF network participants are able to reliably exchange data thanks to their adherence to a set of standards. As GBIF looks to grow in capability, enable exchange of richer content and improve the quality of data, the standards must be revised and evolve accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current standards adopted by GBIF are not yet adequate to accommodate the needs expressed by many potential and existing data publishers. Weaknesses in the model have led to ambiguous or over-complex data representations and unclear documentation, leading to difficulties in data integration and use. The main issues relate to uncertainties around the use of Darwin Core record types, the basisOfRecord element, and the use of Core and Extension vocabularies. Reviewing and updating the core domain model, tightening up the vocabularies and documentation and adopting more robust exchange standards will result in an easier to use, and a wider reaching GBIF data exchange network.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_8"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_8"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF will work with TDWG and other key stakeholders to review existing solutions for a common domain model, working towards agreement on a model to adopt with key partners. This conceptual model should cover the main components of biodiversity information (the domain “classes” such as Specimen, Collection, TaxonName, TaxonConcept, Publication, Sequence) and document the mandatory and recommended properties expected for each component and the vocabularies that should control the properties. A review of existing vocabularies and their current uses will be undertaken and revisions and new vocabularies will be proposed where necessary. A revision of the Darwin Core Archive mechanism and supporting tools, such as the publishing toolkit (IPT) and the data validator, will be undertaken to accommodate the richer content model and the new recommendations from the W3C CSV on the Web working group. GBIF should continue discussions with other key global biodiversity data infrastructures to develop comprehensive catalogues to support discovery and normalisation of instances of the most critical domain classes (particularly TaxonName, TaxonConcept, Collection, Specimen, TaxonOccurrence).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to completing this knowledge graph, GBIF should be equipped to link between people, datasets, cited use and funding agencies through the correct attribution chains using e.g. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and Open Researcher and Contributer ID (ORCID) as potential mechanisms.</p>

<p>TDWG does not yet offer a set of recommendations that can be implemented as an approved standard for a common domain model, although many of the necessary elements have been developed. GBIF is well positioned to move this work forward by offering a new baseline implementation within GBIF.org.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat has recognised that are many of the most serious challenges facing data users arise from the fragmented approach to data integration and data quality that has arisen as multiple infrastructures aggregate overlapping subsets of the same occurrence data. Each data aggregation infrastructure carries out its own harvesting, interpretation, assignment of unique identifiers, normalisation, quality checks, faceting, etc. and offers its own downloads, API and data citation tools. The results of each of these steps are different in each network/infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF, OBIS, ALA (and the Living Atlases), iDigBio, VertNet and GGBN are significant existing networks that seek to address these needs in parallel. The GBIF Secretariat has started discussions with these parties to explore the extent to which they all could combine forces and move towards jointly aggregating data as a shared web infrastructure, producing and maintaining a single shared data product which is replicated globally and supports whatever views and access choices each partner/portal requires. This conceptual model could address the following needs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Every occurrence record should have a globally unique resolvable identifier for use wherever it is accessed. These identifiers could serve as a robust, sustainable basis for persistent reference (as with the International Geo Sample Number, IGSN).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every aggregated record should include the verbatim record, the standard DwC attributes derived from the verbatim form, and an endlessly extensible set of other attributes, including e.g. VertNet interpretation of measurements, OBIS interpretation of associated marine measurements, ALA national taxonomy and spatially-aligned properties, etc. All of the benefits from all of this processing could be accessible to all users regardless of how and where they access the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data quality checks and associated processing should be fully standardised and documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data processing should be extensible to allow additional processing and additional attributes based on taxonomy or geography or e.g. for paleo-records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search and download APIs could be standardised to simplify development of data access tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All infrastructures could adopt a single mechanism for data downloads, DOI generation, and citation tracking. This would make it easier for data publishers to get integrated information on the use of their data through all outlets</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nothing would stop existing and future portals offering specialised value on top of these core services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initial discussions with other platforms have been positive and there is agreement, particularly with ALA and iDigBio to hold a technical workshop to develop a shared plan, including immediate steps to converge practices and a longer-term set of steps to explore closer unification.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most significant challenge to improving the quality of aggregated occurrence data is the continuing need for a comprehensive checklist of known species, and even for a comprehensive list of published scientific names. Interpreting and mapping names depends on the quality and completeness of these resources. Even in cases where names in occurrence records are incorrect or misspelled, better names infrastructure can assist by increasing confidence that fuzzy match algorithms or human intervention is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Delivering these resources is the focus of a number of GBIF Participants and other stakeholders, including the Catalogue of Life partnership, WoRMS, nomenclators (IPNI, Index Fungorum, ZooBank) and many national, regional or taxonomic databases. A comprehensive resource for scientific names and taxon concepts organized at least as a workable reference classification (but with support for additional classifications as appropriate) would also benefit other infrastructures, including Encyclopedia of Life, Biodiversity Heritage Library, Barcode of Life and GBIF nodes, and improve interoperability between data from these infrastructures. It would also be beneficial to accommodate vernacular names, informal names for undescribed species and other identifiers such as Barcode Index Numbers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_9"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_9"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF and many other partners have worked on this challenge and much progress has been made, but we are still far from a comprehensive shared solution. GBIF has been in discussion with Catalogue of Life, EOL, BHL, BOLD Systems, nomenclators and others about pooling resources to deliver the best possible complete nomenclator and catalogue of all species, along with improved tools to enable the taxonomic community to own and maintain these resources more effectively. The challenges are not primarily informatics issues. The most important requirement is to understand the constraints and needs of existing content holders and the features that are required from an infrastructure that can be embraced by the majority of taxonomists. The solution must build on existing initiatives and give sufficient credit and benefit back to those who have invested in developing data. It must be flexible enough to accommodate existing well-managed datasets without disrupting their activity and to accommodate more open mechanisms to support wide community input for taxa which need more work. In the longer term, it should support evolution towards ownership of curation responsibilities by international taxonomic societies or other bodies recognized by researchers for each group. The infrastructure should include processes to review and interpret unrecognized name strings found by GBIF and others in aggregated data. Once these requirements have been resolved, implementation must rapidly follow to offer these resources as open public datasets for use by all.</p>

<p>The Netherlands has coordinated a significant commitment for 2017 and 2018, led by NLBIF and including resources both from Species 2000 and Naturalis. This funding will enable GBIF and partners to direct significant effort to this area over the period.</p>

<p>Natural history collections are the largest source of data on biodiversity outside nature itself. Collectively the worlds natural history collections number about 3 billion specimens and document over 300 years of active human exploration of biodiversity on earth. In addition the fossil remains provide us with glimpses into the very far past before humans existed. The collections and their ancillary materials (images, collectors’ notes, sequences, measurements, etc.), contain colossal amounts of data that should be digitized and shared. Only about 10% of the world’s collections have been digitized and only a portion of digitized collections are shared publicly through the internet. A large number of current GBIF publishers comprise natural history museums and herbaria. The Secretariat will work with Participants to deliver the most comprehensive catalogue possible of collections, including metadata to publicize undigitized collections as a first step towards their digitisation and mobilisation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>GBIF has a range of tools, including fitness-for-use groups, other community consultations, feedback channels, direct communication with authors of scientific studies, and societal demands, to identify and collect data needs. The Ebbe Nielsen Challenge for 2016 focuses specifically on tools and algorithms to identify significant gaps. These gaps may relate to different facets of the data, including geography, taxonomy, time periods, and coverage of particular ecosystems or land units. Addressing these gaps may require focus on gaining additional occurrence records, targeting data areas missing from published records, or getting additional metadata elements. By consolidating and prioritising demands for data content, in the context of already accessible data and knowledge of resources which are not yet available as open data, GBIF will be positioned to inform collection and data holders, funding institutions and political decision makers of the most worthwhile and cost-effective ways to extend the available knowledge base.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_11"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_11"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat will harmonize and document data mobilization demands from different sources. Simple tools are required to support needs capture, including informative documentation and justification for such demands. Automated assessment and reporting of gaps will be included where this proves possible and valuable. This combined information can support transparent decision making and target setting for gap-filling efforts, allowing all interested actors to step in at appropriate levels. GBIF will coordinate with efforts through the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to identify and address significant knowledge and data gaps, including outreach and funding strategies for gap-filling . A thorough, regularly updated overview of data coverage in gbif.org both makes it easier to identify gaps, and to monitor progress and efficiency of mobilization efforts over time. GBIF should offer (e.g. annually) a brief report of significant gaps which need to be addressed. Such a report may be valuable to Participants and funding bodies to stimulate and evaluate digitisation and mobilisation options.</p>

<p>The Secretariat has continued to work with the IPBES Task Force on Data and Knowledge to help prioritize data mobilization based on knowledge gaps encountered through the IPBES assessment process.

<p>GBIF serves as an integration point for any source of evidence of the recorded occurrence of species in time and space. A primary role for the GBIF infrastructure is to serve as a comprehensive single point of access for discovery, access, use and curation of all such evidence. Several classes of data are already well-supported within the GBIF network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These include collections data, observations from field research, and many categories of citizen science data. However, there are other new and developing streams of data which should be accommodated if GBIF is to serve as the platform for supporting comprehensive data assessment and modelling (e.g. for GEO BON Essential Biodiversity Variables, IPBES assessments, Red List assessments, etc.). These include efforts to mine historical data records from literature, genomics activities and particularly barcode-driven surveys, and potentially species-level data from remote-sensing systems. More work is also still needed to engage with the full spread of research activities delivering sampling event data of various kinds. GBIF needs to ensure that it provides simple, effective and beneficial ways for researchers to share these and other streams of Darwin Core compatible data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_12"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_12"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Existing GBIF models include support for occurrence records and for sampling-event datasets which organize occurrence records as sets of observations deriving from a single field sample (which make provision for GBIF to accommodate “absence data” from surveys which did not record a particular species despite searching). These approaches are core to all potential streams of data to be added. GBIF therefore needs to ensure that existing tools and documentation are clear and usable for relevant research communities and that GBIF sufficiently understands existing data management by these communities to avoid proposing unnecessary additional work. During 2016, GBIF is coordinating a consultation which builds on past engagements with genomics activities such as the Global Genome Biodiversity Network. Recommendations from this consultation are expected to guide improvements in GBIF tools, documentation and communications to support publishing of molecular data in formats which can be integrated within GBIF. Several projects are working on automated or human mining of data records from literature. GBIF needs to learn from these initiatives and ensure that its tools support integration in a simple way. GBIF should also seek exemplar projects for bringing occurrence records from remote sensing into the network.</p>

<h4 id="_progress"><a class="anchor" href="#_progress"></a>Progress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first steps toward integrating environmental DNA sequencing data directly into the GBIF occurrence index were taken during 2018, in a pilot collaboration with the UNITE community of Northern European researchers. This database has defined more than 73,000 species hypotheses based on clustering of DNA sequences taken from fungi. These are represented as stable operational taxonomic units (OTUs), linked to a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) and matched to the nearest known taxon name. By publishing these OTUs as a checklist in GBIF, they are now incorporated into the taxonomic backbone. A dataset based on DNA sampling of Danish fungi has already used this development successfully to publish georeferenced occurrences in which only the OTU is provided. This paves the way for publication of many more categories of data from sources such as eDNA in which established OTUs are recognisable but lack a formal scientific name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of incorporating more data using the richer sampling-event format also advanced during 2018, as the informatics team enhanced the representation of such data through listing individual sampling events on the landing page for each dataset, and providing a page for each event listing the number of occurrences of each species contained in the sample, as well as a visualization of the taxonomic distribution. This is the first step in improved visualization of sampling-event data which will eventually help users to link datasets using similar protocols and to represent trends over time, making GBIF a more appealing destination for ecological monitoring data.</p>

Data holders should be encouraged and assisted in sharing data in the richest form appropriate for the data in question (sampling event data where relevant elements are available, occurrence data for other spatially explicit data, checklists otherwise) and with the most open data licences possible. As well as natural history collections, Participants should identify opportunities to build partnerships with citizen science groups and promote the value of open access to data from environmental impact assessments and monitoring.

This has been ongoing for over ten years and is a national conference, between SANBI and Partner Institutions aimed at harmonising biodiversity information sharing and discussing best practice in data and information systems management. It brings together government agencies, funding bodies, scientific, conservation and informatics practitioners to discuss data mobilisation efforts, funding opportunities and showcasing scientific projects which show the use and application of data for science and policy outcomes. SANBI-GBIF biodiversity geo-referencing training conducted in August 2018, alongside the BIMF-FBIP Forum.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many researchers hold potentially valuable data which are not yet in a suitable digital format for integration into GBIF. Historical publications are a similar source of valuable data which remain inaccessible. This offers an opportunity to establish a community platform to capture information on such datasets where the researcher or owner lacks the time or capability to make the data available as a GBIF-compatible dataset, and to enable interested individuals to volunteer time to collaborate with the owner to publish a dataset, potentially in conjunction with a data paper credited to all parties. Such a model may address a key bottleneck in bringing valuable data online.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_approach_14"><a class="anchor" href="#_approach_14"></a>Approach</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GBIF Secretariat, or an interested Participant, should develop a test environment to explore this model. The model should support identification of basic information on datasets which may be rescued, including details of ownership, etc. Volunteers may be required to undergo some training or demonstrate some knowledge of GBIF data publishing and the taxa concerned prior to adopting a dataset for mobilisation. Mobilisation should be include consultation or partnership with the owner and should deliver quality metadata and a valid mapping of the original information. Opportunities should be explored for publication of resulting datasets as data papers as an incentive to all parties.</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the ‘suggest a dataset’ tool in 2017, little progress has been made in this activity area. Although many ad hoc efforts are being made at publisher, node and Secretariat levels to engage holders of important datasets and encourage publication through GBIF, clearly a more methodical approach needs to be devised and implemented if this activity of the implementation plan is to advance along the lines suggested.</p>

<p>Journals are the traditional established avenues for scientific communication. They not only disseminate research findings and other scholarly communications but are increasingly helping to disseminate research data. These data may be provided as supplementary materials or deposited in biodiversity data repositories as a precondition for publication of the paper. However, such data publishing data does not necessarily facilitate its integration with other related data or make the data discoverable and reusable. In order to benefit from data disseminated through journals, the Secretariat will lead or coordinate activity to engage directly with publishing houses, journal editors and authors to promote GBIF-compatible approaches to publication and the use of GBIF-operated repositories as accepted or preferred destinations for supporting data.</p>

<p>GBIF Secretariat will engage with relevant journals in developing and promoting best practices and publishing workflows that reduce the effort required to publish data to GBIF. The aim will be to publish data once but be able to cite it as supporting data for a journal paper and where appropriate produce a data paper as an additional product. The Secretariat will use its experience with Pensoft Publishing where a workflow and a dedicated data paper publishing tool is established.</p>

<p>During 2018, the Secretariat’s science communication coordinator has reached out intensively both to journal publishers and to individual authors in an effort to improve the standard of citations of GBIF-mediated data in research. These communications are often based on specific examples of poor citation practices, and although responses have been mixed there has been positive feedback from several publishers and a commitment to improve citations. Collaboration with Elsevier has helped to improve the visibility of GBIF citations on article landing pages through use of the Scholix platform. Efforts to engage more than 150 individual authors have led to assurances of better citations in future, and also the identification of more than 300 download DOIs which had not been cited in the original articles but can now be linked to the research concerned. In cases where publications were still in a pre-proof stage, the citations were amended to include the DOIs in the citations, thus following the GBIF citation guidelines.</p>

<p>There exists a significant portion of data available through GBIF.org that is not actively curated by a data host. In some cases, there are no resources or desire to make further edits to the datasets. These datasets are effectively orphaned and the GBIF.org version of the dataset is often the last remaining version available on the internet. As GBIF develops mechanisms to provide feedback to data publishers and support curation of datasets, we need to consider that these orphaned datasets will not be updated with corrections or migrated to adhere to modern data standards.</p>

Orphaned datasets will be identified, extracted from the GBIF.org index and loaded into the most suitable data repository supporting versioning: either run by a GBIF participant or a central cloud installation of an IPT. As issues are identified anyone will be able to volunteer to correct the source data, upload a new version into the data repository, document the changes applied and follow editor guidelines. Once republished GBIF.org will reflect the updated data, and the provenance of changes will be traceable through the repository versioning system. Policies for editors, including attribution and the settlement process for disputes will be documented. This entire activity could be led and implemented by a GBIF Participant.</p>
